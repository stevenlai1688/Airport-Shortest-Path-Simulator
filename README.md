# Airport-Shortest-Path-Simulator
UW Madison CS400 project.

Using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm as well as simulated airport distances to calculate the shortest path cost/ cheapest path cost from one node to another.

FlightPath class is the wrapper class for FlightData, which contains flight distance and flight cost accessors.

FlightData class contains predetermined flight distances from 1 airport to another, as well as flight costs from 1 airport to another.
